# DisplayChanger2Wrapper

This software is a wrapper around the displaychanger2 application from https://12noon.com/?page_id=641

The software provides a C#-Forms application which sits permanently in the system tray.

It provides a way to control monitor configurations through a GUI.
You can also set a shutdown timer in the application.

Added configurations can be deleted by rightclicking the config.

The programm directory should look like this:

* Root
    * ConfigFiles
    * Utilities
        * dc2.exe (download from https://12noon.com/?page_id=641)
     * MonitorSwitcher.exe (or any name you choose)

Enjoy :)
