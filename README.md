# DisplayChanger2Wrapper

This software is a wrapper around the displaychanger2 application from https://12noon.com/?page_id=641 thank you a lot for your work!

The software provides a C#-Forms application which sits permanently in the system tray.

You can easily add and remove your prefered monitor configurations.
Added configurations can be deleted by rightclicking the config.

You can also set a shutdown timer in the application.


The programm directory should look like this:
* Root
    * ConfigFiles
    * Utilities
        * dc2.exe (download from https://12noon.com/?page_id=641)
     * MonitorSwitcher.exe (or any name you choose)

Enjoy :)
